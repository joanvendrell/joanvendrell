Large language models (LLMs) have moved far beyond their initial form as simple chatbots, now carrying out complex reasoning, planning, writing, coding, and research tasks. These skills overlap significantly with those that human scientists use day-to-day to solve complex problems that drive the cutting edge of research. Using LLMs in \\quotes{agentic} AI has the potential to revolutionize modern science and remove bottlenecks to progress. In this work, we present URSA, a scientific agent ecosystem for accelerating research tasks. URSA consists of a set of modular agents and tools, including coupling to advanced physics simulation codes, that can be combined to address scientific problems of varied complexity and impact. This work highlights the architecture of URSA, as well as examples that highlight the potential of the system.

ICLM 2026 Submission 2026.        We present a hierarchical distillation and adaptive fine-tuning framework that enables compact small models to operate reliably under the supervision of larger teacher models. Unlike static knowledge transfer, our approach integrates offline policy distillation with a inference adaptive refinement loop, explicitly regulating prompt-domain drift to maintain behavioral alignment. We evaluate this framework within The Universal Research and Scientific Agent, applying it to a Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization task governed by strict memory and latency constraints. Extensive ablation studies across four teacher\u2013student pairs (GPT-5 and GPT-5-nano supervising Llama-3.1-8B and Mistral-7B) demonstrate that hierarchical adaptation significantly improves reliability and format consistency in resource-constrained environments.

JMLR Submission 2026.        We present Chain-based Adaptive Reconfiguration Over Lattices Algorithm (CAROL), a probabilistic framework for test-time refinement of Large Language Models for Hallucination Reduction. Instead of relying on token-level uncertainty, CAROL introduces a semantic measure of uncertainty based on the informational consistency between a generated response and its contextual knowledge. This measure is formulated as a string-submodular objective defined over the lattice of possible textual sequences. This novel formulation allows us to implement a Markov Chain sampling process to maximize the response coherence while adaptively exploring the solution space, formulated as a lattice, preserving theoretical guarantees on convergence and sub-optimality. This stochastic reconfiguration enables the model to iteratively refine responses toward semantically consistent and reliable outputs. The resulting framework provides a unified probabilistic interpretation of semantic consistency and efficient test-time adaptation. Empirical results in question answering and multi-agent reasoning tasks demonstrate that CAROL significantly reduces hallucinations and improves task reliability compared to entropy or likelihood-based baselines.    </p>"},{"location":"publications/publications/#optimality-gap-from-the-lense-of-submodular-optimization-theory-for-a-network-radial-reconfiguration-via-forward","title":"Optimality gap from the lense of submodular optimization theory for a network radial reconfiguration via FORWARD","text":"<p>     Vendrell, J.; Kuhnle, A.; Kia, S. IEEE 65th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) Submission 2026.        Optimal radial reconfiguration in multi-source distribution networks is a fundamental problem in infrastructure management, characterized by a challenging interplay between discrete graph-theoretic constraints and continuous flow optimization. While the problem is known to be NP-hard, practitioners often rely on feasibility-oriented greedy heuristics like \\texttt{FORWARD}. However, these algorithms have traditionally lacked formal performance guarantees, leaving a critical \"optimality gap\" unaddressed. This paper provides the first formal characterization of this gap through the lens of submodular optimization theory. We establish that the quadratic distribution cost function exhibits supermodular properties over a polyforest greedoid capturing the unique requirements of multi-source radiality. Consequently, we prove that the sequential construction process in FORWARD achieves a constant-factor approximation bound, specifically shown to be 2(1-1/m) under a probabilistic observability framework. This bound is further refined by the network's structural parameters, explaining the algorithm's near-optimal performance on small-world distribution grids. Our results bridge the gap between practical network engineering and theoretical optimization, providing a rigorous template for analyzing constrained greedy algorithms in large-scale network design.    </p>"},{"location":"publications/publications/#2025","title":"2025","text":"Monte carlo sampling and qaoa over probabilistic submodular models ResQue Greedy: Rewiring Sequential Greedy for Improved Submodular Maximization Data-driven approaches for pipe life prognosis in water distribution networks: the Barcelona water distribution network case study FORWARD: Feasibility Oriented Random-Walk Inspired Algorithm for Radial Reconfiguration in Distribution Networks FORWARD: A Feasible Radial Reconfiguration Algorithm for Multi-Source Distribution Networks Microgrids optimal radial reconfiguration via FORWARD algorithm"},{"location":"publications/publications/#monte-carlo-sampling-and-qaoa-over-probabilistic-submodular-models","title":"Monte carlo sampling and qaoa over probabilistic submodular models","text":"<p>     Vendrell, J.; Kuhnle, A.; Kia, S.

By integrating a novel set curvature metric within a lattice-based     framework, ResQue Greedy identifies and corrects suboptimal decisions made by the standard sequential greedy     algorithm. Specifically, a curvature-aware rewiring strategy is employed to dynamically redirect the solution     path, leading to improved approximation performance over the conventional sequential greedy algorithm without     significantly increasing computational complexity. Numerical experiments demonstrate that ResQue Greedy     achieves tighter near-optimality bounds compared to the traditional sequential greedy method.

Journal of Hydroinformatics 2025. https://doi.org/10.2166/hydro.2025.003       A water distribution network is a critical infrastructure in a city whose proper function affects significantly human life. However, aging pipe assets require periodic investment plans to reduce the risk of having leaks. In order to maximize the value of the existing water infrastructure and optimize asset investment, assessing and predicting pipe life in water distribution systems has become very important. Up to now, the study for determining relevant variables and pipe failure occurrence has drawn most of the attention, which has scientific value but cannot assist real operations in the water industry. To add practical values to pipe life assessment and prognosis methods, this paper contributes (1) first, several comparable data-driven approaches are proposed to quantify pipe deterioration and the influencing variables, such as pipe diameters, materials and age; (2) then, a prediction method, for the remaining useful life of pipe assets based on the algorithms described previously, is introduced; (3) finally, an easy reading risk-level checklist is presented for all pipe assets to assist the water industry with daily operation, maintenance of assets and renewal of their water networks.

American Control Conference (ACC) 2025. https://doi.org/10.23919/ACC63710.2025.11107625       We consider an optimal flow distribution problem in which the goal is to find a radial configuration that minimizes resistance-induced quadratic distribution costs while ensuring delivery of inputs from multiple sources to all sinks to meet their demands. This problem has critical applications in various distribution systems, such as electricity, where efficient energy flow is crucial for both economic and environmental reasons. Due to its complexity, finding an optimal solution is computationally challenging and NP-hard. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm called FORWARD, which leverages graph theory to efficiently identify feasible configurations in polynomial time. By drawing parallels with random walk processes, our method simplifies the search space, significantly reducing computational effort while maintaining performance. The FORWARD algorithm employs a combination of network preprocessing, intelligent partitioning, and strategic sampling to construct radial configurations that meet flow requirements, finding always a feasible solution. Numerical experiments demonstrate its effectiveness, highlighting its potential for real-world applications in optimizing distribution networks.

This problem arises in critical infrastructure systems such as power distribution, water networks, and gas distribution, where radial configurations are essential for operational safety and efficiency. Optimal solution for this problem is known to be NP-hard. In this paper, we prove further that constructing a feasible radial distribution configuration is weakly NP-complete, making exact solution methods computationally intractable for large-scale networks. We propose FORWARD (Feasibility Oriented Random-Walk Inspired Algorithm for Radial Reconfiguration in Distribution Networks), a polynomial-time algorithm that leverages graph-theoretic     decomposition and random walk principles to construct feasible radial configurations. Our approach introduces novel techniques including strategic graph partitioning at articulation points, dual graph condensation to address greedy shortsightedness, and capacity-aware edge swapping for infeasibility resolution. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis proving feasibility guarantees and establish a compositional framework enabling parallel processing while preserving optimality properties. Comprehensive numerical evaluation on networks ranging from IEEE standard test systems to 400-node small-world networks demonstrates that FORWARD consistently outperforms commercial MINLP solvers, achieving optimal or near-optimal solutions in seconds where traditional methods require hours or fail entirely.

American Control Conference (ACC) 2025. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2511.03059       Microgrids offer a promising paradigm for integrating distributed energy resources, bolstering energy resilience, and reducing the impact of blackouts. However, their inherent decentralization and dynamic operation present substantial energy management complexities. These complexities, including balancing supply and demand, ensuring system stability, and minimizing operational costs, often necessitate solving computationally intractable NP-hard Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) problems. Traditional MINLP solvers struggle with the scalability and feasibility guarantees required for these challenges. To address this, this paper tackles the problem of resource allocation and radial configuration design for microgrid power distribution and proposes and abstracted problem which is solved by introducing a permutation-based iterative search method over the recently introduced FORWARD method to efficiently identify feasible, near-optimal radial network structures while inherently respecting physical constraints. Furthermore, this paper investigates the integration of the proposed method as a warm-start strategy for benchmark MINLP solvers offering a scalable solution for comprehensive microgrid design.
