Information 2022, 13, 438. https://doi.org/10.3390/info13090438       This paper proposes a quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm (QiEA) to solve an optimal service-matching task-assignment problem. Our proposed algorithm comes with the advantage of     generating always feasible population individuals and, thus, eliminating the necessity for a repair     step.

In order to provide a pipe life assessment and prognosis approach     with practical significance, this paper presents: 1) a comparable     approach to quantify impact of different factors (mainly age,     material and diameter) on the occurrence of pipe failures     using statistical reliability model based on cumulative Weibull     distribution, survival model based on neural networks and evolutionary polynomial regression model for pipe deterioration;     2) a prognosis method for the remaining useful life of pipes     using previous algorithms; 3) a maintenance and renewal plan     of the network to assist daily operation of water operators by     means of a checklist including risk levels (low, medium, high)     under different factor ranges.

In this report a new approach of failure rate prediction is presented based on Fuzzy Clustering technic for a more deterministic and accurate implementation of neuro-fuzzy systems. This technique is compared with two benchmark methods: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Adaptative Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS).    URL PDF </p>"}]}
